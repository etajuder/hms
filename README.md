If you have questions that come up when you make modifications. Use the comment box in the bitbucket issues section. If you need something quick, update the issue section and send an email to Dr. Deepak Pinto, he is the owner of the hospital that uses the software. Please copy neilfrndes+hms@gmail.com in the email too. 

If you need a demo of the features we need or chat about how something should look, lets have a skype session or google hangouts. Please dont wait until the last day to ask your questions.

Please create a branch from the master and commit your changes regularly to bitbucket.

Hope to have a great project with you guys!
